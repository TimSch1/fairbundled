# Acknowledgement

We want to acknowledge certain institutions and platforms  that provided useful information and content for the Fairbundled Project.



## Certificate Data

To ensure integrity and validity from early on we make use of the research on certificates for sustainable procurement.

[Kompass Nachhaltigkeit](https://www.kompass-nachhaltigkeit.de/) is a living project which regularly updates guidelines and recommendations for new product groups, as well as sustainability labels, tender examples or suppliers. The labels used in the project are directly adopted from their current scope.

Kompass Nachhaltigkeit is implemented behalf of Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, i.e. [BMZ](https://www.bmz.de/), in cooperation with [Kompetenzstelle Nachhaltige Beschaffung](http://www.nachhaltige-beschaffung.info/).



## Category Data

In order to provide a reasonable product range in adequate category structure, the current implementation of Fairbundled product structure is inspired by the online shop for municipal procurement [KOMMUNALBESCHAFFUNG](https://kommunalbeschaffung.de/).
